    Legal
    -----

    This software contains portions of, or code derived from, SIMH, uClinux,
    and libgba. You must read and understand software-specific licenses
    provided in the LICENSES subdirectory before using this software.

    Prerequisites
    -------------

    You need an RK05 disk image of 5th edition UNIX in order to run gbaunix.
    The Makefile expects to find it as "disks/unixv5.dsk".

    You can obtain the disk image (after reading and understanding the
    license, and ensuring that you are eligible) from:

    http://minnie.tuhs.org/PUPS/

    NOTE THAT THE DISK IMAGE'S SIZE SHOULD BE 2494464 BYTES.

    Running
    -------

    If you only want to run gbaunix, without recompiling it, do the following:

    % cat unixv5.tmp disks/unixv5.dsk > unixv5.gba

    unixv5.tmp is pre-compiled gbaunix, minus the disk image. Once you
    concatenate the disk image, "unixv5.gba" can be used with a Game Boy
    Advance emulator, or on real hardware.

    Compiling
    ---------

    You need an ARM toolchain (such as devkitARM).

    Once you have the disk image as "disks/unixv5.dsk" , simply run make.

### Edit

    This is the official GBAUNIX (R) rom found at
    http://www.kernelthread.com/publications/gbaunix/ with the DSK file
    and an easy to use bash script that compiles the rom. 
    
    If you want to compile the rom in linux, cd into the directory `gbaunix-0.0`
    and run
    `$ sh ./compile.sh`
    
    In Windows, download MSYS which is in releases and run the same command in the
    MSYS console.
    
    In Android, download Terminal Emulator for Android, also in releases, and cd
    into the directory. Android's download directory is in
    `/storage/emulated/0/Download`.
